Folks, hope all of you are gearing up for USHA GheunTak!

We are wrapping up the last few tasks required to be done in the final
week, to make this tournament awesome, and you can help!  Read on!

.. TEASER_END

1. Post tournament party.  We plan to have a party on Saturday night,
   after the finals (~9.30 pm).  We would like to know how many of you
   would be around for the party.  Your captains have already been
   asked for the information.  Nag them to send it to us, ASAP!

2. Beach HAT Tourney. Hopefully, most of you know, but the games for
   the tournament are only on Friday and Saturday (7th, 8th March).
   Since a few of the players are around on Sunday as well, we are
   considering having a HAT tournament early morning on Sunday. But,
   this has received a mixed response, specially, considering the late
   night party on Saturday.  It would help if we can get an idea of
   the number of players interested, and we will only conduct the HAT
   tournament, if we have 50 or more players.

   Please sign up, before midnight on Tuesday, if you'd like to play!

3. First aid and medical help.  We are looking for professional help
   for any medical emergencies, but it would also help to know if we
   had any doctors or those trained in first aid, in the participating
   teams.  Please send us the details of any such players on your
   team, as early as possible.

4. Schedule. The tournament format and schedule are being finalized,
   and we'll get back to you pretty soon, with the draw!

5. T-shirts. We have designed a t-shirt for the tournament. Place your
   orders with your captains, before Monday noon!
